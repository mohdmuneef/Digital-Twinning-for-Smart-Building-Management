# **Digital Twin for Smart Building Management**

This project implements a **Digital Twin** for monitoring and predicting building conditions in real time. Using simulated data and predictive analytics, it provides insights into temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy consumption within a building. The system is built using Python, Flask, and Plotly for visualization, and includes a machine-learning model for future predictions.

## **Introduction**

**Digital Twin for Smart Building Management** aims to create a virtual model of a building, capable of real-time monitoring and predictive analysis. The twin replicates building conditions (temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy consumption) and offers a web interface for building managers to view data trends, forecast future conditions, and optimize energy efficiency.

---

## **Features**
- **Simulated Data Generation**: Generates realistic building condition data for testing.
- **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Displays current conditions in a user-friendly web interface.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predicts future conditions using a machine learning model.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts for visualizing historical and predicted data.
- **User Customization**: Choose which data to visualize (e.g., temperature, humidity, energy consumption).

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap, Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- **Simulated Data**: Custom Python script

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-twin-smart-building.git
cd digital-twin-smart-building
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Data Simulation Script**
To start generating simulated data:
```bash
python data_simulation.py
```
This script will continuously append data to `building_data.csv`.

### **4. Start the Flask Web Application**
Once the data simulation is running, start the web app:
```bash
python app.py
```
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to view the web interface.

---

## **Usage**
1. Open the web application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Select the data type you want to display (e.g., Temperature and Humidity, Energy Consumption).
3. View real-time and predicted data in interactive charts.
4. The app automatically updates data every minute, using the simulated values from `building_data.csv`.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Implement notifications for anomalies or critical conditions (e.g., energy spikes).
- **IoT Integration**: Connect with live IoT sensors for real-time data collection.
- **User Authentication**: Add login functionality with role-based access control.
- **Advanced Machine Learning**: Implement more sophisticated models for improved prediction accuracy.
