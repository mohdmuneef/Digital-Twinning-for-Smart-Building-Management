### **Title**:
**Digital Twin for Smart Building Management**

### **Description**:

This project creates a **Digital Twin** for real-time monitoring and prediction of building conditions like temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy consumption. It includes a Flask web application that visualizes current data and forecasts future conditions using machine learning. The system also simulates building environment data, stores it, and applies predictive analytics to optimize energy efficiency and improve occupant comfort.

### **Key Features**:
- Real-time monitoring of building conditions (temperature, humidity, occupancy, energy consumption)
- Predictive analytics using a trained machine learning model (Linear Regression)
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask and Plotly for data visualization
- Simulated data generator for testing and demonstration purposes
- Future condition predictions for the next 24 hours based on historical data
